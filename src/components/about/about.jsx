            <h1>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about
              React.js and <br /> Node.js. I excel in blending technical and
              visual aspects to craft exceptional <br /> digital products,
              prioritizing user experience, precise design, and optimized <br />{" "}
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since starting my web development journey in 2015, I've embraced{" "}
              <br />
              challenges and kept up with the latest tech trends. Now in my
              early thirties, <br /> seven years in, I'm building cutting-edge
              web apps using Next.js, TypeScript, <br /> Nestjs, Tailwindcss,
              Supabase, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a progressive mindset, I enjoy the entire product development
              process, <br /> from ideation to execution. Off duty, you'll find
              me on Twitter, tracking <br /> startup journeys, or unwinding.
              Follow me for tech insights and public project <br /> updates on
              Twitter or GitHub.
            </p>
